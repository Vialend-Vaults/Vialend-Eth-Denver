3.0 note:

deployStrat.sol doesn't work. because of error to compile the bin: 
ERROR:

solc --optimize --overwrite --bin DeployStrat.sol -o ../build
Warning: Contract code size is 33097 bytes and exceeds 24576 bytes (a limit introduced in Spurious Dragon). This contract may not be deployable on mainnet. Consider enabling the optimizer (with a low "runs" value!), turning off revert strings, or using libraries.

another concern is a high gas cost of the run time deployment will be applied.



steps to deploy and test:
1. run solc and abigen in _solc.sh from wsl
2. modify and run index.go to deploy 
3. run other tests.
